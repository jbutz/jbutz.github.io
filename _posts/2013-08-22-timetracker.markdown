At work I was keeping track of my hours using a spreadsheet, but every month or so I would have to adjust the formulas to be able to calculate all of my time. It worked, but wasn't great. One Friday evening I decided to create a simple one user time tracking app that could run on top of Heroku. Using Sinatra and MongoDB I was able to create a small application that did exactly what I wanted.
