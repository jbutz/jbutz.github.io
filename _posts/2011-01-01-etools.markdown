The eTools are a set of web applications that replicate functions from a terminal-based ERP system.
They allow the more efficient use of licenses since people don't &quot;sit on a license&quot; and prevent others from using a license. The eTools are built on top of a simple framework that allows for nearly infinite amounts of customization while still maintaining the same look and feel.
