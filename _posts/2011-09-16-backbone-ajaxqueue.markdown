The first Production Schedule would sometimes try to send over one hundred AJAX requests at a time. 
This had a severe impact on the browser and on the server. One weekend I decided to combine Backbone.Sync and the jQuery AjaxQueue plugin. 
At the start of the next week I dropped it into the application and everything began running more smoothly.
