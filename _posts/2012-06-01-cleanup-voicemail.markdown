Did you know that Google Chrome can have difficulties downloading files once you have 100 of them with the same file name? This is the reason this PowerShell script was created. People who got a lot of voicemail started having issues listening to it once they had downloaded 100 of them. This script runs on the file server and cleans up old voicemail.
