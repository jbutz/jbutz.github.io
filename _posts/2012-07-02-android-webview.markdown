I haven't had many opportunities to experiment with developing Android applications, so this was a small project I did to learn some of the basics. 
I created it in such a format that it would be flexible enough for someone else to base an application off of in case they so desired. 
It supports viewing web pages packaged within the application or on the Internet, and its behavior can be modified with only a few changes.
