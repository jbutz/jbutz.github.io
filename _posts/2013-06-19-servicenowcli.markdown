I created this small program for two reasons. Firstly to help me learn C#. Secondly to allow me to easily download copies of scripts from Service Now in a format I could use them.
With this program you can download Business Rules and Client Scripts from your ServiceNow instance for any table. I hope to eventually add more functionality.
