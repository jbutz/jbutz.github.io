The Production Schedule is the largest of the eTools. It adds completely new functionality to the ERP system to assist with production scheduling. It is currently on its third version. The first two versions allowed someone to drag-and-drop Work Orders to figure out the order the Work Order would be worked on. The third version was created to make use of a scheduling algorithm that was developed. This algorithm allows for scheduling to continue even when someone is on vacation.
