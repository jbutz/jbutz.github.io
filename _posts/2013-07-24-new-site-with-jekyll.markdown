The old version of my site was powered by laravel, and for what I used it for that was over-kill. I have tried out [Octopress](http://octopress.org) in the past and liked it, so I thought I would try the source and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It quickly turned into my new site! Jekyll is very easy to learn and gives you an amazing amount of flexibility out of the box. Once you add on the plugins you can create there seems to be almost no limit.

I was initially only going to handle the projects that I post, since that is the biggest part of this site. Then I decided I wanted to add in the blog I had started. That work working well, but they I ran into some difficulty with having pagination on the blog, but not on the projects. Luckily, I was able to find a [blog post](http://realjenius.com/2012/12/01/jekyll-category-tag-paging-feeds/) that lead me down the path to a plugin that would work for my situation.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seems to be amazing and I look forward to seeing what else I can do with it.
