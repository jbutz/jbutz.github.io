        <p>GitHub has a lot of my code, including some of my more popular work.
        Don't forget to look through the origanizations on my profile for some additional work I have contributed to.</p>

        <p>I've started using GitLab more and more and I am really enjoying it. The features are excellent and keep evolving.
        At the moment all the code is private, but that is likely to change.</p>
