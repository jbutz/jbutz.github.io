Last week a newletter went out that I had never heard of. It is called "Hacks && Happenings" and it is put out by a group called [Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/). In their [September 2013 Issue](http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=244b5370d41b5cf4146ec517c&id=c5483caef3) my [Time Track](/project/personal/timetracker.html) project was mentioned! I didn't even know about it until my boss forwarded me the newsletter.

Needless to say, I am now following the newletter and keeping an eye on the Indy Hackers website for any meetups I want to take part in. Thank you Indy Hackers.
